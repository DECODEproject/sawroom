# Blockchain smart-contracts in human language

Sawroom integrates the [Zenroom VM](https://zenroom.org) to be used as a transaction processor in the [Sawtooth](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/) blockchain distributed by the Linux Foundation's [Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/) consortium.

The goal is facilitate the creation of transaction families based on Zenroom and the [Zencode human-friendly language for smart-contracts](https://decodeproject.eu/blog/smart-contracts-english-speaker), in particolar to bind the blockchain to the free online service [ApiRoom](https://apiroom.net) that makes it very easy to create an online API tied to any database and the Sawroom blockchain.

## Quick start

To try the Sawroom setup with a running Sawtooth is best to use Docker.

### Prerequisites

Sawroom's docker image requires **docker 20.10.6** or newer: make sure you don't have an older version and if you do install a latest version from [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

### Run Sawroom

Our scripts will facilitate the use with some special options that
will setup a persistent storage on the disk of your host machine
inside the `/usr/lib/sawroom` directory. All data is saved there and
nowhere else!

To prepare the setup do:

```
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/sawroom
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -u) /var/lib/sawroom
```

Then pull the Sawroom docker image ready to run a testnet node

```
docker pull dyne/sawroom:testnet
```

Then create the new keys for this instance:

```
./run keys-create
```

One here should note down the output and communicate these keys to
enable the peering between nodes.

**Sawroom is running inside a Tor network and the nodes will find each
other automatically and tunneling through Tor**!

To fire up the node use the script `./run` without arguments.

To enter the running node open another terminal and use the script `./shell` inside sawroom.


That's all for now! more will follow...
